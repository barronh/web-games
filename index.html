    These are several of games that I developed as learning projects. They are simple -- just a few hundred lines of code.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="space/index.html">Asteroids</a>: The goal was to make a generalizable game. So you can change the game completely by making 5 images and editing the references to them.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="space/ninja.html">Ninja variant</a> for my older son.</li>
            <li><a href="space/firetruck.html">Firetruck variant</a> for my younger son.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
